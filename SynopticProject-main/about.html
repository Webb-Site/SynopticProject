		<p>This site was created for the Engineers Without Borders Challenge 2021 by 5 university students who, after reading the brief, noticed that the residents of Lobitos have an issue with access to transport and also with the conditions of the roads. We began thinking of ways we could combine these themes, while also realising that other things we had read could be included inside of this website, so we added those functions too. This was our solution.</p>
