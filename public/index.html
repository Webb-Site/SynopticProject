			    <h2>Take the Bus!</h2>
				<p>Next time you have to travel try using a bus service! <br>
				The buses have a large capacity, this will mean less people travelling individually so its good for the environment and. The revenue made from these bus tickets, after the upkeep of the buses, will go back into the community including repaving roads and beach clean ups.

				<h2>Use a Bike!</h2>
				<p>For shorter journeys, grab a bike for one of the new bike stations around the town (map provided) <br>
				Using bikes is by far the most environmentally friendly way to travel around Lobitos, while also having other benefits like keeping you healthy and being able to travel off-road. And when you’re done, just drop it back to one of our stations!

				<h2>Do a Car Share!</h2>
				<p>Want something quick with a sense of community? Look and see if any of the members of Lobitos are running car shares today. <br>
				This saves gas by cutting the amount of people using their cars and helps to clean the environment.
